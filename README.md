# cameron-demo-pura

A simple web server demo featuring a custom Express server hosted on Amazon AWS's Elastic Beanstalk and an Amazon RDS database managed through Sequelize, a JavaScript library that keeps your Database secure. We also have some Handlebar templates here, sine it helps us focus on the back end components.

- Add user records to our database
- List and update user records
- Delete user records
